Main Branch Jenkins Test - 2025-08-07 00:48:30

ðŸš€ TESTING MAIN BRANCH AUTO-TRIGGER

This commit to the main branch should:
âœ… Be detected by Jenkins SCM polling (H/1 * * * *)
âœ… Trigger PIPE-02 (Main Branch CI/CD) pipeline automatically  
âœ… Include all stages: Docker Build, Tests, Helm Validation, Push Docker, Push Helm, GitOps Prep
âœ… Execute without the previous Jenkinsfile syntax error

Expected Timeline:
- Commit pushed now
- Jenkins detects change within 1-2 minutes
- Main branch build starts automatically
- Full PIPE-02 pipeline execution

Status: Testing automatic main branch CI/CD triggering ðŸŽ¯
