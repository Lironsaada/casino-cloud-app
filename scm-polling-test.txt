SCM Polling Test - 2025-08-06 20:45:30

Testing automatic build triggering after Jenkins restart:
✅ Cleared corrupted git cache directories
✅ Configured git safe.directory globally  
✅ Restarted Jenkins pod for clean state
✅ PAT credentials should be working (updated in UI)

Expected result: 
- This commit should trigger SCM polling within 1-2 minutes
- Jenkins should discover all branches and start builds automatically
- No "fatal: not in a git directory" errors should occur

Test branch: jenkins
