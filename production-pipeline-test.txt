# Production Pipeline Test

**Test ID**: PROD-PIPELINE-20250806-175709
**Timestamp**: Wed Aug  6 17:57:09 IDT 2025
**Purpose**: Verify production CI/CD with real Docker and Helm

## Expected Production Features
- ✅ Real Docker builds (not simulation)
- ✅ Real pytest execution in containers
- ✅ Real Helm lint, template, package
- ✅ Real DockerHub push (for main branch)
- ✅ Real Helm OCI push (for main branch)  
- ✅ Real GitOps updates (for main branch)

## Pipeline Types
- PIPE-01: Feature branches (Docker build + test + Helm validate)
- PIPE-02: Main branch (Full CI/CD with pushes)
- PIPE-03: Main branch (GitOps ArgoCD integration)
